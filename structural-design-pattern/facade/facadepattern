Facade Design Pattern provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in the system.
Facade decouples a client from complex subsystem.
Delegates call to methods of existing subsystems.
Client communicate with the system by sending requests to Facade.
Facade then forward requests to appropriate subsystem objects.
It defines a higher level interface that makes a subsystem easier to use.
Basically hides the complexities of the interfaces.
It does not add any new functionality.
Can be applied to any point of development, usually when the number of interfaces grow and the system gets complex.
Subsystem interfaces are not aware of the facade and they should not have any reference to the facade interface.

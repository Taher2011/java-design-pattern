Adapter pattern makes two incompatible interfaces compatible without changing their existing code.

Interfaces may be incompatible, but the inner functionality should match the requirement.

Adapter patterns use a single class (the adapter class) to join functionalities of independent or incompatible interfaces/classes.

Adapter pattern converts the (incompatible) interface of a class (the adaptee) into another interface (the target) that clients require.
